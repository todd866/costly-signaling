## Overview

Coalition formation requires commitment verification: how can agents distinguish genuine allies from defectors before costly collective action? Costly signaling provides a general solution across biological scales—signals must cost more to fake than defection pays.

As coordination stakes increase, signals become increasingly "individually dominated" (apparently irrational). A structural cluster emerges: ritual, sacred markers, deviation punishment, identity fusion, evidence resistance. These are functional homologies—convergent solutions to the commitment verification problem.

## Key Results

- **Separation condition**: Signal cost must exceed defection bonus + outside option value
- **Discount factor asymmetry**: Defectors pay more because they discount future coalition benefits more heavily
- **Cross-scale homology**: Same mechanism from quorum sensing → colony recognition → immune tolerance → human ideologies
- **Evidence-resistance prediction**: Evidence against beliefs can strengthen commitment (raises signal cost)
